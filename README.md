- Working in a team of 3 people, we drew up a plan as follows:
1) Discuss and clarify the idea and goals of the application
2) Map out workflow and divide tasks.
3) We established a time frame od 1 days to obtain the minimum characteristics of the application.
4) After getting the mvp ready, we worked on the design and extra features for the application (minimum length characters for the password, functions to edit, delete, add new profiles).
